I _know_...

> Already?

Yeah, I have a bunch of ideas on what to write, but never committed to sitting down with one and running with it.

I guess it's more the pressure that I put on myself to deliver _versus_ my reluctance of writing something for the sake of it.

I'll have this filler _non-post_ take up this space for now.

In the meantime, enjoy this random Shiba gif.
