It’s around 4 PM. I’m sitting at a table in our hotel room, typing on my laptop. Linus is napping on the bed, and Chloe is next to him, scrolling on her phone. We’re here for a day-and-a-half getaway with Linus’ best friends and their parent(s).

Earlier today, we had brunch at the equestrian park and went on a sightseeing cruise. Now, we’ve just checked in, refreshed ourselves, and are taking a break before heading out for some water play with the kids.

I was just reading my 2023 review and felt glad I had included general outlines for this year. Reflecting on those points has inspired me to write this year’s review.

### 2024 Review  

**More celebrations of life and love.**  
- We celebrated my younger sister Mabel’s marriage in Korea.  

**More new experiences for Linus and the family.**  
- Linus took his first flight to Chiang Mai.  
- We attended a Korean wedding.  
- I took a month off work without pay—a story that deserves its own blog post (though I lost the draft and got lazy).  
- We experienced our first visit to New Zealand (for work).  
- We also had our first early miscarriage this year.  

**More organization and order at home.**  
- I’ve made more of an effort to tidy up at home, and we went all out scenting up our space.  
- Strangely, we’ve managed to go through the entire year without dining chairs.  

**More energy through exercise and a more active lifestyle.**  
- I exercised the most I’ve ever done during my one-month sabbatical but failed to stick to a routine.  
- On the downside, I’ve moved backward in terms of weight loss. This needs to be my top priority in 2025.  

**Have another child (and be ready for it).**  
- As noted above, we experienced an early miscarriage. I’m now less intentional or expectant but will welcome a new family member spontaneously if it’s meant to be.  

**Build more things, for fun!**  
- I started a life-sim game that I got serious about but am now seriously procrastinating on.  
- Sadly, this was the only project I built this year.  

**Cook at home more and experiment with new recipes.**  
- I barely cooked—just a few French toasts, pancakes, and some mac and cheese.  

**Read more books.**  
- I made significant progress here, reading more than I ever have in previous years.  
- My one-month sabbatical kickstarted this habit, and I’ve been juggling several books at once.  
- I plan to join PewDiePie’s book club in 2025.  

**Write here more!**  
- I managed only two posts this year and lost one draft. I’ll try to do more.
