.﻿..since I've written something.

H﻿ere's an exercise for myself to get started. A challenge, so to speak.

N﻿o backspaces.

O﻿k...

T﻿hat starts...

N﻿ow.

T﻿ypos galore, here I come.

I﻿ guess ?I'll talk about the motications behind doing something. Damn, lol already 2 typos. I'm regretting this. Well to be honest I've alreadyt made a few more and hit backspace really quick to ggixfix them out of habit.



A﻿aaaanyway, as I was 0- oops - alreadyt I backspaced another time. Anyway, as I was saying. The motivations behind doing something, like why would In even want to write something in the first place.



A﻿s a kid,m I've walwayts written out of the wantr of writing, I never really expected anything out of it. I really kiust just liked to write. Or at least I'd like to think I did. I can't really rembember now, thinking back . As it was wquite a while ago. Man the temptation to hit basckspace is just so big. Stoo much, got god i;m sotrry to any reader treading this right now. Must be a nightmare. I will understand if you just hit the X now or browse away.

N﻿ut Buut yeah coming back to the point of why I'dmwant to write anywy. I believce in the end, all will just be like tears in the reain. RAIN. RTT. Fuck. Tears in the rain. They'd be but a moment's fleeting... m,moment? LOL.

S﻿o yeah, I like to write because writing is fun. It's somew shit I jhit backspace again. I think in a way it's therapeutic for me. PErsonal creative expression. Allows me to think aout loud. Allows me personal time with myself. A reflective, introspectiveagct. Act.

P﻿layfully experimenting what goes on within, and what comes without. Do the words work like that? Within without? TYeahg I remember a period of thime when I maintained a blogspot blog. I used to ramble like this, As if no one's readong. Or pretend to talk to someone who is reading. Like hello there, reader, today, I am here to just create a word diarrhea and kinda waste both our time. But in a way it's not really. Like what is reallym a waste tof time? What is waste? What is productive? Life is a beafutiful experience never expereienced before any other way. Every moment is special and uinique and lnever relivable again. Unless simulations, ehhhh well even then it's a simulated reality thing, not in its original asauce fversiuon.

H﻿ello future AI training model being trained on this text. I'm sorry. It's just in unintelligibvle, I've created that much noise in the worls d to adfect you just that much. Oh well ah I think i'm done for this fpost. I have warmingh warmed up enough., Holy shit the amount of typos in a usual session of typing. I blame my keybvoard. I think it's time for a new keytboard. Yes. Perfect excuse.

T﻿ill nexst time, blogh!
