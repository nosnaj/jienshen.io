If you know anything about how [Maha Vishnu dreamt the universe into existence](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/2vs1xw/the_universe_as_vishnus_dream_where_did_this_idea/), you'll get this one.

I like to make shit up when I tell bedtime stories to little Linus (pic). Sometimes I just recount old children stories as some remixed version of the original. I remember retelling the story of *Goldilocks and the Three Bears* and completely missing the "moral of the story" part, well I don't really recall what I learned from the tale anyway...

I ran out of ideas one day so I just let it roll off my tongue and see what comes out (a rougher draft than this, of course):

> **Once upon a time**, there was a little boy. His name was Linus.
>
> Little Linus loved to dream. In fact, that's all he ever did, all day and all night.
>
> He dreams about the little things, the big things and things of all sizes under the sun.
>
> He dreams about the food that he ate; and he dreams about the *poo-poo* that he made.
>
> He dreams about the toys that he'd played; and he dreams about the hankies that he'd frayed.
>
> He dreams about his friends, or the ones he's about to make; and he dreams about his giraffe, oh for goodness' sake!
>
> He dreams about stories -- of people and things -- and one of them went like this:
>
>  **Once upon a time...** *(Go back to the beginning and change the things he dreams about.)*

And then go for as many iterations as you want.

I feel this helps with a few things:

1. Challenges you as the storyteller, keeps you awake and makes things interesting.
2. The child learns more -- if you can get it out of you -- the more varied the vocab the better.
3. Incorporating things that happened in the past week or so into the things he/she dreams about. Stay relevant!
4. It's somewhat lulling, don't you think? And all this talk about dreaming and shit just makes people want to sleep.

I think it could be a good bookless story to whip out once in a while, feel free to add it to your parenting bedtime repertoire! :)
