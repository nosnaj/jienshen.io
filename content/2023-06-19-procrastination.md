They call you the thief of time. \
\
I often wonder, why do you need more time?

Do you steal time so you can squander it on more of your thievery?

Are you kleptocratic of your own time, or that of others?

When they say “time is a social construct”, did they mean it in a way that when you procrastinate you’re really stealing from others?

As in that time is this seemingly finite thing that we share from a pooled resource with others who also value time?

So rather than procrastinating = stealing my own time, it’s like I’m stealing others’ time for something that “doesn’t matter”?
