You get so productive when procrastinating. Only towards the wrong thing at the wrong moment.

I can wash dishes, do the laundry, play a game of Dota, write a blog post... Really, do anything but the thing that I "need" to do.

I have recently started developing a life-sim game about making games. The irony is that I was inspired to make this game in part due to a friend who has started a lot of unfinished games. I wanted to illustrate the process and decision-making required in completing a game within a year.... And here I am writing a blog post about making a game about making a game. I think I'll first accomplish a world-record in meta-chaining meta things before I can finish the game. What about a  video series about how I started writing about the game I'll never finish?

The craziest thing is if my friend finally publishes a game and I have never finished working on the game that is supposed to illustrate the focus and effort required in finishing a game dev project. Oh the meta-irony!

Ok so I guess this is the cue for me to go work on my game.

Ta!

I'm posting irregular updates about my game on my twitter. I have a dev-thread that I pinned on there. I wonder if I'll actually finish this project! Don't wanna abandon yet another passion project. :)

Cheer me on!!
