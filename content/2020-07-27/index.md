Wow, it's been a whole year!

Time for a quick _bullet-point style post_ in the theme of _big events/things_ that happened since the last post?

You betcha.

#### In no particular order:

- The COVID-19 outbreak. A pandemic.
  - It's become such a worldwide household name.
  
- Birth of baby Linus (my son!).
  - Named after [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) _and_ [Linus van Pelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_van_Pelt).
  
- A lot of things happened with the last startup I was in. (Kinda in order)
  - Completed facilitating an internal management training program.
  - Moved to a new office.
  - Organized an internal hackathon.
  - Laid people off.
  - Left the startup.
  
- Joined a new startup!
  - Stealth mode. Ask me about it.
  
- Built my own desktop. (_Finally!_)
  - Maybe I'll dedicate a post to it.
  
I was relying on my photo album to do a quick recall of all the happenings in the past 1 year, I realize how quickly the album starts to get populated with baby pictures after Linus' birth!
